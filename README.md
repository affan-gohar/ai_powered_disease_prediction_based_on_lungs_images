This project is a deep learning-based solution for detecting lung diseases, including COVID-19, pneumonia, and tuberculosis (TB), using chest X-ray images. The model automates the detection process, helping healthcare professionals make faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Detects COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lung conditions with an accuracy of up to 85%.
- **Automation**: Reduces diagnostic time for healthcare professionals by automating the detection of lung conditions.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image analysis and classification.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Other Libraries**: 
  - OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib (for data visualization)
## Results
85% Accuracy: Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing between COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal lungs.
Reduced Diagnostic Time: Helped healthcare professionals reduce diagnostic time by automating lung disease detection.
Future Work
Include more diseases like tuberculosis (TB) and expand the dataset to improve generalization.
Integrate the tool into a web application for real-time diagnosis.
Collaborate with hospitals for real-world testing and further refinement of the model
